Put posts in the `_posts` directory with the format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. 

To run a local web server, use the command
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
